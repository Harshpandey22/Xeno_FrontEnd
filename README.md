# Pandey Dhalla

**Pandey**, if you did not clear the next round, *you’re done*. 

I mean, let’s be honest, that’s it, right? The next round is your shot at redemption, your last chance to prove you’re not just a mere mortal who couldn’t make it past a few simple challenges. I bet you can almost hear the clock ticking down, the tension building up in your head, the moment of truth approaching fast.

But hey, if you *do* manage to somehow sneak through, well, congratulations! You've just narrowly avoided the *inevitable* disaster. Who knows? Maybe you’ll even look back and laugh… though, probably not. 

But don’t get too comfortable. This isn’t a fairy tale. There’s no magic wand here. The real challenge is out there, and it’s going to bite hard. Keep that in mind, and remember, there's always a reason why people call it a "nail-biting experience."
